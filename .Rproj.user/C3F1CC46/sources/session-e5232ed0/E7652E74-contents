# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)



```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))


```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_cmnn_mini <- data_cmnn %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c("Guinea", "Brazil", "Uganda"))

# Rename columns
data_cmnn_mini1 <- data_cmnn_mini %>% rename(Country= Entity) %>%

```

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries.
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_cmnn_wide <- data_cmnn_mini2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Country, values_from = DALYs_lost)

# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
kable(data_cmnn_wide)
```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table.
# Create the line graph

# Reshape the wide data into long format
data_cmnn_long <- pivot_longer(data_cmnn_wide, cols = c(Brazil, Guinea, Uganda), 
                          names_to = "Country", values_to = "Value")

# Plot the data using ggplot2

ggplot(data_cmnn_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +                                
  labs(
    x = "Year",                                        
    y = "DALYs Lost",                                    
    color = "Country"                                   
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings

Uganda and Guinea had big increase of the DALY diseases burden due to CMNN in 1990, however these trends decreased significantly between 1990 and 2020. In the other hand,the CMNN burden was generally lower in Brazil. Note that these results show that important efforts was made in those three countries between 1990 and 2020.
