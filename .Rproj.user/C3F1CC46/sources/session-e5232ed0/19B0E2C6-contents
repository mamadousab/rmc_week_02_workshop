# Overall Disease Burden

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_overall_mini <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_overall_wide <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
```

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
```
