# Overall Disease Burden

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data

data_overall <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))

view(data_overall)

#Rename Entity and DALYs exclude code


data_overall<-data_overall %>% rename (country=Entity)

data_overall %>% rename(DALYs=`DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)%>% select(-Code)





```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_overall_mini <- filter(data_overall,Entity %in% c("Brazil","Uganda","Guinea"))
view(data_overall_mini)

```

## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.

data_overall_wide <- pivot_wider(data_overall_mini,names_from = Entity,values_from = Year)

view(data_overall_wide)
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
kable(data_overall_wide)
```

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 


plotly::ggplotly()
Library(ggplot2)

 ggplot(data_cmnn_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +  # Line thickness for better visibility
  labs( 
       x = "Year", y = "DALYslost", 
       color = "Entity") +
  theme_minimal()

 
  ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = Year, y = DALYs_lost, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Trend of DALYs Burden Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "DALY Burden (Age-standardized Rate)",
       color = "Country") +
  theme_minimal()

   ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE)
